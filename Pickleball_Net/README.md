# Pickleball Net STL Files

These STL files are parts of a **pickleball net** that we designed and made.  

Each file in this folder corresponds to a component of the net:

- **net_pole.stl** – Vertical pole for the net  
- **net_connector.stl** – Connector piece for the net frame  
- **net_base.stl** – Base support for stability  

Feel free to use these files for personal projects or reference.
